# ABSTRACT
#### In this project we focus on automating Heater so, we need not to trigger it manually daily morning rather it will get ON and heat water according to environement temperature. Environement temperature is considered here because in summer season we need not want water to be too hot but in winter season we need hotter water. So depending on place and season we decide how much our water needs to be hot. If we heat water for less time its temperature will be less than when heat it for long time. So we sense temperature with LM35 temperature sensor and control heater with relay. When and how much time relay is closed is controlled by Atmega 328p which takes Temperature sensor value and accordingly controls Relay. Also there is a option to switch it manually to avoid this automation. This is programmed in multifile programming format and simulated in simulides. CI/CD is also implemented with build and Static analysis.
